# Phlomis

Phlomis is a project for replacing the Node.js based build tools of [Sage](https://github.com/roots/sage) to a PHP based one with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [Robo](http://codegyre.github.io/Robo/).

The name comes from the genus of plants called [Phlomis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlomis). One of the members of the genus is Phlomis russeliana which has the common name Turkish sage. That and the "Ph" at the beginning makes it a perfect name for a PHP oriented fork of Sage.
